-- The types expresses the state-pattern of Tennis, the Type constructors take the
-- previous score as an argument hence disallowing illegal state transitions
-- some transitions use dependent types to enforce that it is only the player
-- who had the advantage that can win after the next ball.

-- All types are disjoint, i.e. instead of making one type GameScore and many type constructors
-- which feels like inheritance. Here we use composition of types, this strategy seems more extensible
-- (not that tennis is ever going to be extended...)

||| I wonder why we need to use the full form of type definition and why the
||| simpler form doesn't work i.e.
||| data PointScore PlayerPoints PlayerPoints = MkPointScore p1Points p2Points
data PointScore : PlayerPoints -> PlayerPoints -> Type where
     MkPointScore: (p1Points: PlayerPoints) -> (p2Points: PlayerPoints) ->
                   PointScore p1Points p2Points

||| This type, representing the fact that one player has reached Forty allows to
||| reduce cardinality (=~ cyclomatic complexity) of the implementation of nextScore
||| for PointScore below. PointScore already has to deal with the different 
||| PlayerPoints.  
data GameBall : Player -> PlayerPoints -> Type where
  FromThirtyP1 : (PointScore Thirty p2Points) -> GameBall P1 p2Points
  FromThirtyP2 : (PointScore p1Points Thirty) -> GameBall P2 p1Points
  FromGameBall : (GameBall player otherPlayerPoints) -> -- here use the proof of not thirty
                 GameBall player (nextPoint otherPlayerPoints)

    MkAdvantage: Deuce -> (player: Player) -> Advantage player
  
  data Win : Player -> Type where
    WinFromAdvantage: Advantage player -> Win player
    WinFromGameBall: GameBall player _ -> Win player

||| All types are disjoint, so we need a Union type in order to define a
||| function on any type of score.
||| BTW I'm curious as to why we can't define score as a type alias, like an 
||| OR-type find wrapping and unwrapping of the Union type really cumbersome
